<h2> Welcome to the home page of BirdYodaGaming! </h2>
The site is pretty barebones at the moment, but it will eventually be full of cool stuff! Some of the ideas I have include:

<ul>
<li> posting Angry Birds plush videos I plan on making.
<li> posting updates on my collection of various Angry Birds merchandise. (mostly plushies.)
<li> maybe some gaming videos too? After all, the website is called BirdYodaGaming...
<li> some fun coloring pages and other printable activities I could make/find?
<li> linking to other resources for Angry Birds plush fans, perhaps?
</ul>
<p>

And that's all the ideas I have for now. For now, here's an image of a sample Bomb plush I found online that vaguely reminds me of a flamingo:

Also here's an article for taking your Angry Birds (or Bad Piggies) on vacation with you, should you decide to do that:
